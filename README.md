# Disciple Tools - Quick Comments

Tired of writing the same old comments every day? The Quick Comments plugin will help you speed up the process!

## Purpose

The Quick Comments plugin allows users to post quickly without having to manually type in repetitive comments. It helps save time and encourages posting updates.

## Usage

Go into any post page (contacts, groups, etc.) and you'll see a new dropdown menu named 'Quick Comments'. At first it'll appear as empty, so you'll have to _quicken_ existing comments by clicking on the quicken button next to it.

#### Will Do

- Create quick comments
- Remove quick comments
- Forwards compatible with new post page types

#### Will Not Do

- Will not delete posted comments upon _unquickening_ a quick comment
- Will not allow you to add quick comments from other post types


## Requirements

- Disciple Tools Theme

## Installing

- Install as a standard Disciple.Tools/Wordpress plugin in the system Admin/Plugins area.
- Requires the user role of Administrator.
